To enhance this task management program and analyze user productivity, these are the goals we are striving for, with libraries included.

### 1. **Pandas**
- **Purpose**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Usage**: You can use Pandas to create DataFrames for your tasks, which makes it easy to perform operations like grouping by day, calculating completion times, and generating statistical summaries.
- **Example**: Store task completion times and analyze them based on the day of the week or time of day.

### 2. **NumPy**
- **Purpose**: A library for numerical computations.
- **Usage**: Useful for statistical analysis, such as calculating averages and standard deviations of completion times.
- **Example**: Calculate average time taken to complete tasks over a week.

### 3. **Matplotlib or Seaborn**
- **Purpose**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Usage**: Create visualizations such as bar charts or heatmaps to represent task completion patterns over time.
- **Example**: Plot completion rates by hour of the day to identify peak productivity periods.

### 4. **Scikit-learn**
- **Purpose**: A library for machine learning.
- **Usage**: You can build predictive models to forecast task completion times based on historical data.
- **Example**: Use regression techniques to predict how long future tasks might take based on past performance.

### 5. **Statsmodels**
- **Purpose**: A library for statistical modeling.
- **Usage**: Useful for conducting more advanced statistical tests and analyses.
- **Example**: Perform time series analysis to identify trends in productivity over time.

### 6. **Datetime**
- **Purpose**: Part of the standard library.
- **Usage**: Handle and manipulate date and time objects for more precise tracking.
- **Example**: Track how long each task takes to complete by storing start and end times.

### 7. **Plotly**
- **Purpose**: A library for interactive visualizations.
- **Usage**: Create dashboards or interactive charts to display productivity metrics.
- **Example**: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize task completion trends.

### Additional Features to Consider Adding:
- **Time Tracking**: Record start and end times for each task to analyze how long tasks take.
- **Categories or Tags**: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, urgent) and analyze productivity by category.
- **Daily/Weekly Reports**: Generate summaries of task completion rates and average times over different periods.
- **Reminders/Notifications**: Integrate reminders for tasks based on user-defined deadlines.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Store historical task data and provide insights on long-term productivity trends.
